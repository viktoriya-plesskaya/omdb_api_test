Requirements


Build a web application that uses the OMDB API (Please try to use built-in functionalities of JavaScript instead of libraries like Axios).

Have a search bar at the top of the page from where the user can search for a movie.

The search results should be displayed as movie in a way that showcases the title, the cover image, and links to the details about the movie.

Each movie box can be collapsed or expanded (by clicking on details button) to see the movie details.

You have freedom to develop the UI/UX of the web page (Avoid using UI libraries).
